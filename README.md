**Decentralized Giving, Rewarding Generosity**

Giftify is a **decentralized investment gifting platform**. It empowers creators through transparent, blockchain-based donations while rewarding gifters with yields generated from their contributions. By leveraging **USDe**, an internet-native digital dollar, Giftify creates a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem for creators and gifters.

## üìñ About

Giftify combines the power of web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) to transform traditional donations. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Gifters Donate in USDe:** Donations are made using **USDe** and locked into the platform's smart contracts.
2. **Decentralized Staking in sUSDe:** Contributions are staked in **sUSDe**, generating decentralized yield over time.
3. **Mutual Benefits:**
    - **Gifters** receive a portion of the staking yield, rewarding their generosity.
    - **Creators** receive the donations plus any remaining yield.

Through the use of blockchain technology and **Merkle Tree-based yield allocation ([service](https://github.com/onekill0503/giftify-service))**, Giftify ensures fairness, transparency, and efficiency in all transactions.

## üí° Problem To Solve

Traditional donation platforms lack decentralization and often fail to incentivize continuous support for creators:

- **For Gifters:** Donations feel like a one-way transaction, offering no financial benefit.
- **For Creators:** Dependence on inconsistent support hinders their financial independence.
- **For Platforms:** Transparency and fairness in donation management can be hard to achieve.

Giftify introduces a **decentralized, win-win model** where gifters gain financial rewards, creators receive donations transparently, and all interactions are powered by blockchain technology.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Our Workflow

---

Giftify simplifies decentralized donations while rewarding gifters through a transparent and efficient process:

1. **Gifting in USDe:**
    - Gifters contribute using **USDe**, a stable digital dollar optimized to address creator.
    - Donations will incur a 5% platform fee. The remaining amount will be divided into two sections: 70% will be allocated to the gifter's portion, and 30% will be allocated to the creator's portion.
2. **Staking Contributions in sUSDe:**
    - Donations from smart contract will be stacked in **sUSDe**, a generate a yield.
    - Funds are locked to generate yield untill achive minimum withdraw amount.
3. **Mutual Rewards:**
    - **Gifters:** Receive a portion of the yield as a reward for their generosity.
    - **Creators:** Gain access to their donations plus any remaining yield, enabling sustainable support.
4. **Claiming Rewards:**
- Gifters can claim their yield after the creator initiates a withdrawal and the cooldown period has ended.
- The distribution of rewards is managed fairly using a **Merkle Tree** to calculate entitlements.

Giftify ensures that all interactions between gifters and creators are fair, secure, and powered by decentralized technology.
